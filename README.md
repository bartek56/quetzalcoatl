# Quetzalcoatl 2

This is to be the next version of the Quetzalcoatl MPD client.

Watch this space.

It currently uses:

* Breeze icons
* [material.io icons](https://material.io/)
* [Qt Creator's .clang-format](https://github.com/qt-creator/qt-creator/blob/master/.clang-format)

Previous versions are described here:

* [Quetzalcoatl 2.0 Screenshot](http://duganchen.ca/quetzalcoatl-2-0-screenshot/)
* [Quetzalcoatl Music Player Client For MPD](https://duganchen.ca/project/software-development/quetzalcoatl-mpd-client/)

In the meantime, here's a demo of its robust handling of server events: events generated by another MPD client, and the event of losing the connection to MPD.
