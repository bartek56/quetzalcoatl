# Quetzalcoatl 2

This is to be the next version of the Quetzalcoatl MPD client.

Watch this space.

It currently uses:

* Breeze icons
* [Qt Creator's .clang-format](https://github.com/qt-creator/qt-creator/blob/master/.clang-format)

Previous versions are described here:

* [Quetzalcoatl 2.0 Screenshot](http://duganchen.ca/quetzalcoatl-2-0-screenshot/)
* [Quetzalcoatl Music Player Client For MPD](https://duganchen.ca/project/software-development/quetzalcoatl-mpd-client/)

In the meantime, here's a demo of its robust handling of server events: events generated by another MPD client, and the event of losing the connection to MPD.

## Developer's Guide

Generally speaking, build it like this if you're developing it:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON

Doing a debug build will (usually) enable QDebug logging, and this will also give you a compile_commands.json file that you can use to set up clang-based tooling.

Then you can run the application:

    ./quetzalcoatl

Or the unit tests:

    ctest
